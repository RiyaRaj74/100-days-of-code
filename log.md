##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress:** 
I learnt about Bit Manipulation today. It was fairly easy once understood well.
Learnt about Get Bit, Set Bit, Clear Bit and Update Bit. I also learnt Sorting.
I found it interesting. Read about Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.
I am learning a lot everyday but I need to revise more, things are slipping away too.
